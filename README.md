# NYC JOB PORTAL

This web application is built with Create React App and other various tooling like (eslint, prettier, babel, etc.).

## Installation

Clone the repo locally  
`git clone https://github.com/bklynate/nycjobportal.git` for https

or

You'll need to run `npm i` or run `yarn` in both the client and root folders as they both have a `package.json`.

To run locally, you'll also need to setup API Keys for Google inside a file you'll create example: `server/config/dev.js`
```bash
      clientID: 'Some key here'
      clientSecret: 'Some key here'
      cookieKey: 'Some key here'
      ...
